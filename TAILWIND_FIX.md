# Tailwind CSS v4 to v3 Migration Fix

## Problem
The error occurs because Tailwind CSS v4 has moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package, but Create React App doesn't work well with this new configuration.

## Solution
We've downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3 which is more stable with Create React App.

## Steps to Fix

### Method 1: Using the Fix Script (Recommended)
1. Double-click `fix-and-start.bat` 
2. This will automatically:
   - Remove old dependencies
   - Install correct versions
   - Start the application

### Method 2: Manual Fix
1. Delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm start`

### Method 3: Command Line
```bash
# Remove old installation
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Package.json**: Downgraded Tailwind CSS from v4.1.11 to v3.4.1
2. **PostCSS Config**: Added `postcss.config.js` with proper configuration
3. **Tailwind Config**: Updated for v3 compatibility
4. **CSS Files**: Added Tailwind directives to both App.css and index.css

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Updated Tailwind version
- `postcss.config.js` - Created for PostCSS configuration  
- `tailwind.config.js` - Updated for v3 compatibility
- `src/index.css` - Added Tailwind directives
- `fix-and-start.bat` - Automated fix script

## Verification

After running the fix, you should see:
1. No compilation errors
2. Application starts on http://localhost:3000
3. Tailwind CSS classes working properly
4. Search functionality fully operational

## If Problems Persist

1. Ensure Node.js version is 14 or higher
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try running `npm audit fix` if there are dependency warnings
4. Check that no other PostCSS configuration files exist

## Alternative: Using Yarn

If npm continues to have issues, try using Yarn:
```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
yarn start
```
